Description: This is an R package that implements a library of standard queries 
             that run against the OMOP-CDM. The purpose of the library is to help 
             new users to learn how to query the CDM. The queries in the library 
             have been approved by the OHDSI community.The query library will be 
             mainly used for training purposes, but will also be a valuable 
             resource for the experienced users.
